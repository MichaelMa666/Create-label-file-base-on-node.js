# Create-label-file-base-on-node.js
Request:
      (1):Coutomer request the label of product need to be saved as file.
      (2):The tool will be used in factory. So it must be light weight. As the result, Manger let me make it base on node.js.
      (3):It will use scanning spear to scan the label.
